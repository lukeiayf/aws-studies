• Define your cloud infrastructure using a familiar language:
	• JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Java, and .NET
• The code is “compiled” into a [[Cloud Formation]] template (JSON/YAML)
• You can therefore deploy infrastructure and application runtime code together
	• Great for [[AWS Lambda]] functions
	• Great for Docker containers in [[ECS - Elastic Container Service]]
