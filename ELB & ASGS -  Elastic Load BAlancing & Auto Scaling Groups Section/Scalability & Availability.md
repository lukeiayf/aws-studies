• Scalability means that an application / system can handle greater loads by adapting.
• There are two kinds of scalability:
	• Vertical Scalability (increasing the size of the instance)
	• Horizontal Scalability/ elasticity (increasing the number of instances/systems)
• Scalability is linked but different to High Availability

**Availability**

• High Availability usually goes hand in hand with horizontal scaling
• High availability means running your application / system in at least 2 Availability Zones
• The goal of high availability is to survive a data center loss (disaster)
