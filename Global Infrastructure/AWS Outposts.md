• Hybrid Cloud: businesses that keep an on- premises infrastructure alongside a cloud infrastructure
• Therefore, two ways of dealing with IT systems:
• One for the AWS cloud (using the AWS console, CLI, and AWS APIs)
• One for their on-premises infrastructure

**• AWS Outposts are “server racks” that offers the same AWS infrastructure, services, APIs & tools to build your own applications on-premises just as in the cloud**

• AWS will setup and manage “Outposts Racks” within your on-premises infrastructure and you can start leveraging AWS services on-premises
• You are responsible for the Outposts Rack physical security

**Benefits:**

• Low-latency access to on-premises systems
• Local data processing
• Data residency
• Easier migration from on-premises to the cloud
• Fully managed service
