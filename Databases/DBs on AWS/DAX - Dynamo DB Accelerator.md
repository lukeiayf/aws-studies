• Fully Managed in-memory cache for DynamoDB
• 10x performance improvement – single- digit millisecond latency to microseconds latency – when accessing your DynamoDB tables
• Secure, highly scalable & highly available
• Difference with ElastiCache at the CCP level: DAX is only used for and is
integrated with DynamoDB, while ElastiCache can be used for other databases

**Global tables**
