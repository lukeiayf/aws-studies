One of the most popular AWS services

EC2 = elastic compute cloud = infrastructure as a Service

Consists of:
- Renting Virtual Machines (EC2 - VMs);
- Storing data on virtual drives (EBS);
- Distributing load across machines (ELB);
- Scaling services using auto-scaling group (ASG);

All of this can be configured using the [[EC2 sizing & configuration options]] provided in the  [[EC2 User Data]] script

EC2 instances must have a security policy, decided by their [[EC2 security groups]]
