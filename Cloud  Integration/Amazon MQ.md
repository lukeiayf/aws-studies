• SQS, SNS are “cloud-native” services: proprietary protocols from AWS
• Traditional applications running from on-premises may use open protocols such as: MQTT, AMQP, STOMP, Openwire, WSS
• When migrating to the cloud, instead of re-engineering the application to use SQS and SNS, we can use Amazon MQ
• Amazon MQ is a managed message broker service for RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ
• Amazon MQ doesn’t “scale” as much as SQS / SNS
• Amazon MQ runs on servers, can run in Multi-AZ with failover
• Amazon MQ has both queue feature (~SQS) and topic features (~SNS)
