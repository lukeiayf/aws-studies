• AWS is pushing for ”hybrid cloud”
	• Part of your infrastructure is on-premises
	• Part of your infrastructure is on the cloud
• This can be due to
	• Long cloud migrations
	• Security requirements
	• Compliance requirements
	• IT strategy

expose the S3 data on-premise?
• [[AWS Storage Gateway]]!
